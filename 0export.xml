  <summary>create self-installing bundles for distribution on CD</summary>
  <description>
However, it is sometimes useful to bundle a program and its libraries together
on a CD (for example) so that it can be used on machines without a network
connection, or where the network is very slow. It is also useful for archival
purposes, in case the original web-sites supplying required libraries become
unavailable.

0export takes the URI of a program and creates a &quot;setup.sh&quot; file; a self-
extracting archive containing everything needed to run the program. This file
can be executed on a machine without a network connection to install or run the
program.

Unlike the bundles created by the related zero2bundle program, programs
installed using setup.sh are added to the Zero Install cache and are therefore
still shared between users, and will get updates over the web where possible.</description>
